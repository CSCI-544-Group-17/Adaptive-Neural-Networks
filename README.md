# Adaptive-Neural-Networks

In developing our baseline models for both the REPEAT algorithm and Progressive Neural Networks (PNN), we strictly adhered to the foundational principles laid out in their respective original papers, allowing us to create baseline models adept at handling multi-class scenarios. 
Detailed insights into the training methodology of our Adaptive Neural Network (ANN), PNN and FNN, which incorporates these adapted versions of REPEAT and PNN, are thoroughly outlined below:
